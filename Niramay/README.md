# Niramay

AI-powered self-healing cloud monitoring system.
Detects failures in a simulated cloud environment
and automatically remediates them with minimal
human intervention.

---

## What It Does

Niramay monitors a food delivery demo application
that simulates a cloud environment. When failures
occur, the system detects them, classifies the root
cause and executes automated healing actions.

The pipeline has three main components:

**Component C** is the demo application. A food
delivery app that simulates cloud failures including
API errors, latency spikes and service outages.

**Component B** is the detection and analysis layer.
It ingests logs from Component C, runs them through
a multi-engine detection system, performs AI-powered
root cause analysis and produces structured failure
alerts with incident reports.

**Component A** is the self-healing layer. It
receives alerts from Component B and executes
the appropriate remediation action automatically.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Demo application | Python FastAPI |
| Message queue | RabbitMQ |
| Real-time storage | Redis |
| Permanent storage | OpenSearch |
| AI analysis | Ollama with LLaMA3 |
| Frontend | React TypeScript |
| Infrastructure | Docker Compose |

---

## Pipeline Workers

| Worker | Stage | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Detection Worker | Stage 2 | Runs 4 detection engines, scores anomalies, pushes to analyser queue |
| Analyser Worker | Stage 3 | Runs causal engine (LLM or rule fallback), generates incident reports |
| Dispatcher Worker | Stage 4 | Sends alerts to Component A, stores healing records for verification |
| Verification Worker | Stage 4 | Verifies healing outcomes, retries or escalates on failure |

---

## Detection Engines

| Engine | What it detects | State |
|---|---|---|
| Feature Rule Engine | Status codes, latency, failure tags | Stateless |
| Rate Based Engine | Sustained error rate over time window | Redis |
| Silence Detection Engine | Service stops producing logs | Redis |
| Baseline Anomaly Engine | Deviation from historical average | Redis |

---

## Causal Engine

The Analyser Worker runs a causal engine for every detected anomaly:

- **LLM mode**: When `requires_llm` is true, queries a local Ollama
  instance (LLaMA3) with enriched anomaly context to produce root
  cause analysis with confidence scoring.
- **Rule fallback**: When LLM is disabled or fails, uses a rule-based
  fallback that maps anomaly reasons to known root causes.

Output: `{ root_cause, confidence, suggested_action, analysis_type }`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Node 18 or higher

### Run with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Wait for all services to be healthy then open:
- Frontend dashboard: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- RabbitMQ management: http://localhost:15672
- OpenSearch: http://localhost:9200

### Run traffic simulation

```bash
cd backend
python simulation/traffic_generator.py
```

### Run tests

#### Backend (pytest)
```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/ -v
```

#### Frontend (vitest)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run test
```

---

## CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)

The project includes a declarative `Jenkinsfile` at the root for automated integration and testing.

### Local CI Execution
You can simulate the Jenkins pipeline locally using the provided script:
```bash
./scripts/local_ci.sh
```
This script will:
1. Run all backend unit tests.
2. Run all frontend unit tests.
3. Attempt a trial Docker build of both services.

### Jenkins Setup
To establish the pipeline in a Jenkins instance:
1. Create a new **Pipeline** job.
2. Set **Definition** to "Pipeline script from SCM".
3. Point to this repository and specify the `healing-ui` branch.
4. Ensure Jenkins has **Docker** and **Node.js** installed on the worker nodes.
